# Programming Contests Preparation through Online Judges

This repository contains some codes that I wrote to prepare for miscellaneous programming contests. Problems, solutions, along with other detailed descriptions are listed below. Updates to this repo may be made periodically.

## Probem Lists

Detailed descriptions for these problems are included in a .md file in the folder that contains the source codes. Do note that my coding styles and efficiencies of the solutions tend to get better as I go further along.

#### I've given up on keeping detailed information about my solutions after I've finished my 500th problem. This will instead just be a big code dump. I've deleted a bunch of stuff for clean-up purposes. I might work on a project that actively scraps the online judge website that I use in the near future.
